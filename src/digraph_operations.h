/** Calculates the product of the adjacency matrices of two digraphs.
 *
 *  Digraphs are stored as sparse adjacency matrices. By multiplying the underlying
 *  matrices one can derive paths and powers of the graphs.
 *
 *  Let \f$A\f$ and \f$B\f$ be the adjacency matrices of two arbitrary digraph. #scc_adjacency_product
 *  returns \f$A B\f$.
 *
 *  The main purpose of this function is to derive paths and powers. Let \f$A\f$ be an adjacency matrix of some digraph.
 *  \f$A A\f$ then gives the adjacency matrix of the digraph that contains all path of length two in the original digraph.
 *  Let \f$I\f$ be the identity matrix, then \f$(A + I) A\f$ gives the second power of the digraph. That is,
 *  all possible paths of length two or less. Moreover, if \f$A_2 = A A\f$ then \f$A A_2\f$ gives
 *  all paths of length three and \f$A_2 A_2\f$ of length four. If \f$A_p = (A + I) A\f$, then \f$(A + I) A_p\f$
 *  gives the third power and \f$(A_p + I) A_p\f$ gives the fourth power.
 *
 *  \code
 *	// Dummy digraph generator
 *  scc_Digraph my_dg = some_digraph();
 *

 *  scc_Digraph my_dg_path3 = scc_adjacency_product(&my_dg, &my_dg_path2, false);

 *  \endcode
 *
 *  \param[in] dg_a the first digraph of the product.
 *  \param[in] dg_b the second digraph of the product.
 *  \param     force_loops when \c true, forces self-loops in \p dg_a (i.e., all vertices have an arc to themselves).
 *  \param[out] out_dg the digraph described by the product of the adjacency matrices of \p dg_a and \p dg_b.
 *
 *  \note \p dg_a and \p dg_b must contain equally many vertices.
 *
 *  \note The output digraph will never have self-loops (independently of \p force_loops).
