/** Main digraph struct stored as sparse matrix.

 *  Stores the digraph in Yale sparse matrix format. For any vertex `i` in the digraph,
 *  `#tail_ptr[i]` indicates the arc index in #head of the first arc for which `i` is the tail, and `#tail_ptr[i+1]-1`
 *  indicates the last arc. If `#tail_ptr[i] == #tail_ptr[i+1]`, there exists no arc for which `i` is the tail.
 *  Thus if `i` is a tail for at least one arc, `#head[#tail_ptr[i]]` is the head of the first arc for which
 *  `i` is the tail, and `#head[#tail_ptr[i+1]-1]` is the last.
 *
 *  In other words, if there is an arc `i` -> `j`, there exists some `k` such that `#tail_ptr[i] <= k < #tail_ptr[i+1]` and `#head[k]==j`.
